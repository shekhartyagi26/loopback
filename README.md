LoopBack is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that enables you to:

  * Create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding.
  * Access data from Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB, SOAP and other REST APIs.
  * Incorporate model relationships and access controls for complex APIs.
  * Use built-in push, geolocation, and file services for mobile apps.
  * Easily create client apps using Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs.
  * Run your application on-premises or in the cloud.

LoopBack consists of:

  * A library of Node.js modules.
  * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generators for scaffolding applications.
